    "### Understanding Documents and Document IDs in Vespa\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documents** are the backbone of how Vespa organizes, stores, and retrieves data. Grasping how documents and their unique identifiers work is essential for effectively leveraging Vespa's powerful search capabilities. Let's dive into the essentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Document in Vespa?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **document** in Vespa is a structured piece of data that the system indexes, stores, and searches. Think of it as a record or an object containing various **fields** such as attributes, text, or metadata relevant to your application. Each document represents a single entity like a product, article, or user profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components of a Document:**\n",
    "- **Fields:** These are key-value pairs where the key is the field name (e.g., `title`, `price`) and the value is the corresponding data.\n",
    "- **Document ID:** A unique string identifier that distinguishes each document.\n",
    "- **Schema:** Defines the structure of the document, specifying the types and properties of its fields (e.g., string, integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Imagine you have an online store. A product document might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"fields\": {\n",
    "    \"title\": \"Smartphone X\",\n",
    "    \"description\": \"Latest model with AI-powered features\",\n",
    "    \"price\": 699.99,\n",
    "    \"availability\": true\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"id\": \"product:12345\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Document Configuration and Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "When setting up Vespa clusters, you specify which **document types** each cluster will store. This configuration plays a crucial role in:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Garbage Collection:** Helps manage the deletion and cleanup of documents if garbage collection is enabled.\n",
    "2. **Default Routing:** Determines the default routes for incoming documents. By default, a document is sent to all clusters that store its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Configuration:**\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<documents>\n",
    "    <document type=\"product\" selection=\"product.timestamp > now() - 86400\" />\n",
    "</documents>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Document Distribution and Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Vespa uses the **Document ID** to distribute documents across different nodes in a cluster. This ensures efficient storage and quick retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numeric Location:** Derived from the Document ID, it determines where the document is stored.\n",
    "- **Buckets:** Logical containers grouping documents with similar numeric locations. Documents in the same bucket share certain bits in their numeric location.\n",
    "- **Co-localized Storage:** Ensures related documents are stored together in the same bucket, enhancing retrieval speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "If two products have IDs `product:electronics:1001` and `product:electronics:1002`, they might be stored in the same bucket if their numeric locations share specific bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Document IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Document IDs** are unique identifiers that Vespa uses to manage documents. They follow a specific format and play a vital role in how documents are stored and retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure of a Document ID:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "id:<namespace>:<document-type>:<key/value-pair>:<user-specified>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Namespace (Required):** A string for logical separation of documents. It doesn’t affect how Vespa processes documents but helps avoid ID conflicts.\n",
    "   - **Example:** `id:store:products:12345`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Document-Type (Required):** Defines the category of the document as specified in your schema.\n",
    "   - **Example:** In `id:store:products:12345`, `products` is the document type.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key/Value Pair (Optional):** Helps control document distribution across buckets. Only relevant for **streaming** or **store-only** document types.\n",
    "   - **`n=<number>`:** Used for testing bucket distributions.\n",
    "   - **`g=<groupname>`:** Groups documents by a hashed group name for co-localized storage.\n",
    "   - **Example:** `id:store:products:g=electronics:12345`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **User-Specified (Required):** The unique part of the ID, often the main identifier like a product ID.\n",
    "   - **Example:** `12345` in `id:store:products:g=electronics:12345`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "id:store:products:g=electronics:12345\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Namespace:** `store`\n",
    "- **Document Type:** `products`\n",
    "- **Group Modifier:** `g=electronics`\n",
    "- **User-Specified ID:** `12345`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage in APIs:**\n",
    "To add a document using this ID:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/document/v1/store/products/docid/12345 \\\n",
    "     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n",
    "     -d '{\n",
    "           \"fields\": {\n",
    "             \"title\": \"Smartphone X\",\n",
    "             \"description\": \"AI-powered smartphone\",\n",
    "             \"price\": 699.99,\n",
    "             \"availability\": true\n",
    "           }\n",
    "         }'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Vespa Uses Document IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "Vespa leverages Document IDs to efficiently distribute and manage documents across the cluster:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numeric Location Calculation:** Based on the Document ID, Vespa calculates a numeric location that determines the document's storage node.\n",
    "- **Bucket Assignment:** Documents with similar numeric locations are grouped into the same bucket.\n",
    "- **Efficient Retrieval:** Storing related documents together in buckets enhances retrieval speed and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Tips:**\n",
    "- **Modifiers Usage:** Only use key/value pair modifiers (`n` or `g`) for streaming or store-only document types. Avoid them for regular indexed documents to prevent performance issues.\n",
    "- **Unique Identifiers:** Ensure the user-specified part of the Document ID is unique to avoid conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Document Expiry\n",
    "\n",
    "Vespa can automatically expire documents based on certain criteria using **garbage collection**. This helps manage storage by removing outdated or irrelevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setting Up Expiry:**\n",
    "1. **Define a Timestamp Field:**\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   field timestamp type long {\n",
    "       indexing: attribute\n",
    "       attribute {\n",
    "           fast-access\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Configure Garbage Collection:**\n",
    "   ```xml\n",
    "   <documents garbage-collection=\"true\">\n",
    "       <document type=\"product\" selection=\"product.timestamp > now() - 86400\" />\n",
    "   </documents>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Selection Expression:** Determines which documents to keep. Documents not matching `product.timestamp > now() - 86400` (i.e., older than one day) will be expired.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caution:**\n",
    "- **Testing Selections:** Use tools like `vespa visit` to ensure your selection expressions correctly identify documents for expiration.\n",
    "- **Performance Impact:** Ensure fields used in selections are indexed as attributes with fast access to avoid slowing down garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Command:**\n",
    "To see which documents would be preserved:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vespa visit --selection 'product.timestamp > now() - 86400' --field-set \"product.timestamp\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "To see which documents would be removed:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vespa visit --selection 'not (product.timestamp > now() - 86400)' --field-set \"product.timestamp\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fieldsets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fieldsets** allow you to specify which fields should be returned during read operations, optimizing performance by limiting the data fetched.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Fieldsets:**\n",
    "1. **Built-in Fieldsets:**\n",
    "   - `[all]`: Returns all fields and the Document ID.\n",
    "   - `[document]`: Returns original fields and the Document ID.\n",
    "   - `[id]`: Returns only the Document ID.\n",
    "   - `[none]`: Returns no fields (internal use).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Custom Fieldsets:**\n",
    "   - Specify a list of fields to retrieve.\n",
    "   - **Example:** `product:title,price`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Fieldsets:**\n",
    "- When performing a read operation like `get` or `visit`, specify the desired fieldset to control which fields are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "To fetch only the `title` and `price` of products:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vespa visit --selection 'product.title contains \"Smartphone\"' --field-set \"product:title,price\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Documents** in Vespa are structured data units comprising fields, a unique Document ID, and a schema.\n",
    "- **Document IDs** follow a specific scheme that helps Vespa distribute and manage documents efficiently across clusters.\n",
    "- **Configuration** of document types in clusters ensures proper routing and garbage collection.\n",
    "- **Buckets** and **co-localized storage** enhance performance by grouping related documents.\n",
    "- **Fieldsets** optimize data retrieval by allowing selective fetching of fields.\n",
    "- **Document expiry** helps maintain storage efficiency by automatically removing outdated documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these fundamentals equips you to effectively structure, manage, and query your data in Vespa, ensuring high performance and relevance in your search applications."

    "### Understanding Schemas in Vespa\n",
    "\n",
    "Schemas are essential in Vespa as they define the structure and behavior of your data. They determine how documents are stored, indexed, and searched. Let's explore what schemas are, how to create and manage them, and the key components involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Schema in Vespa?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **schema** in Vespa defines a **document type** and specifies what computations (like ranking profiles) you want to perform on it. Think of a schema as a blueprint for your documents, outlining the fields they contain and how those fields are processed during indexing and searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Document Type:** Represents a category of documents, such as `music`, `books`, or `products`.\n",
    "- **Fields:** Attributes or properties of the document, like `title`, `artist`, or `price`.\n",
    "- **Rank Profiles:** Define how documents are scored and ranked in search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining a Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Schemas are stored in files with a `.sd` extension within the `schemas/` directory of your application package. Each schema file typically contains definitions for documents, fields, fieldsets, and rank profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Schema (`music.sd`):**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "schema music {\n",
    "    document music {\n",
    "        field artist type string {\n",
    "            indexing: summary | index\n",
    "        }\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components Explained:**\n",
    "- **Document Block:** Defines the `music` document type with its fields.\n",
    "- **Fields:** Each field has a name, type, and indexing instructions.\n",
    "- **Fieldset:** Groups specific fields (`artist`, `title`, `album`) for easier querying.\n",
    "- **Rank Profile:** Specifies how documents of this type are ranked during searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components of a Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Types and Fields:**\n",
    "   - **Document:** The main entity, such as a song in the `music` schema.\n",
    "   - **Field:** An attribute of the document. Each field has a type (e.g., `string`, `int`) and indexing options.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fieldsets:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Group multiple fields together to streamline search queries and limit the data returned during read operations.\n",
    "   - **Built-in Fieldsets:**\n",
    "     - `[all]`: Returns all fields and the Document ID.\n",
    "     - `[document]`: Returns original fields and the Document ID.\n",
    "     - `[id]`: Returns only the Document ID.\n",
    "   - **Custom Fieldsets:**\n",
    "     - Defined by listing specific fields.\n",
    "     - **Example:** `fieldset myset { fields: artist, title, album }`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rank Profiles:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Determine how documents are scored and ranked in search results.\n",
    "   - **Inheritance:** Rank profiles can inherit from other profiles, allowing for reusable ranking logic.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     rank-profile song inherits default {\n",
    "         first-phase {\n",
    "             expression {\n",
    "                 nativeRank(artist,title) +\n",
    "                 if(isNan(attribute(popularity)) == 1, 0, attribute(popularity))\n",
    "             }\n",
    "         }\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Structs and Struct-Fields:**\n",
    "   - **Struct:** A composite type grouping multiple fields into a single unit.\n",
    "   - **Struct-Field:** Defines how specific fields within a struct are indexed and searched.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     struct email {\n",
    "         field sender type string {}\n",
    "         field recipient type string {}\n",
    "         field subject type string {}\n",
    "         field content type string {}\n",
    "     }\n",
    "\n",
    "     field emails type array<email> {\n",
    "         indexing: summary\n",
    "         struct-field content {\n",
    "             indexing: attribute\n",
    "             attribute: fast-search\n",
    "         }\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inheritance in Schemas and Document Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of schemas and document types, promoting reusability and reducing duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Schema Inheritance:**\n",
    "- A schema can inherit another, gaining all its definitions.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```yaml\n",
    "  schema books inherits items {\n",
    "      document books inherits items {\n",
    "          field author type string {\n",
    "              indexing: summary | index\n",
    "          }\n",
    "      }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Document Type Inheritance:**\n",
    "- A document type can inherit fields and rank profiles from another document type.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```yaml\n",
    "  schema music inherits items {\n",
    "      document music inherits items {\n",
    "          field artist type string {\n",
    "              indexing: summary | index\n",
    "          }\n",
    "      }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Reusability:** Common fields and rank profiles can be defined once and inherited by multiple document types.\n",
    "- **Consistency:** Ensures that similar document types share the same structure and ranking logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Managing Multiple Schemas and Content Clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "Vespa allows you to define multiple schemas within an application, each potentially mapped to different content clusters. This flexibility helps in scaling and optimizing performance based on different document types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Content Cluster with Multiple Schemas:**\n",
    "- All schemas are stored within a single content cluster.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```xml\n",
    "  <content id=\"maincluster\" version=\"1.0\">\n",
    "      <documents>\n",
    "          <document type=\"albums\" mode=\"index\" />\n",
    "          <document type=\"lyrics\" mode=\"index\" />\n",
    "          <document type=\"tracks\" mode=\"index\" />\n",
    "      </documents>\n",
    "  </content>\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Indexing:**\n",
    "- Determines how field data is processed and stored for efficient searching.\n",
    "- **Options:**\n",
    "  - **index:** Creates a text index for full-text search.\n",
    "  - **attribute:** Keeps the field in memory for sorting, grouping, and filtering.\n",
    "  - **summary:** Includes the field in search result summaries.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Match Modes:**\n",
    "- Define how query terms match field data.\n",
    "- **Examples:**\n",
    "  - **exact:** Matches the entire term.\n",
    "  - **prefix:** Matches terms that start with the query string.\n",
    "- **Special Operators:** When dealing with arrays or maps, operators like `sameElement()` ensure matches occur within the same struct element.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling Field Sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "While Vespa doesn't set a maximum size for fields, large fields (like long strings or large arrays) can impact memory and performance. To manage this:\n",
    "- **Use Summary Classes:** Limit which fields are returned in query responses.\n",
    "- **Set Limits:** Use `limit` or `hits` to control the size of result sets.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",

    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Changing Indexing Modes:**\n",
    "- Destructive changes require validation overrides.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  To change a field from `index` to `attribute`, update your schema and add a validation override:\n",
    "  ```xml\n",
    "  <validation-overrides>\n",
    "      <allow until=\"2024-12-31\">indexing-change</allow>\n",
    "  </validation-overrides>\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Renaming Fields:**\n",
    "- Not directly supported. Use one of the following methods:\n",
    "  1. **Drop and Refeed:**\n",
    "     - Remove the old field.\n",
    "     - Add the new field.\n",
    "     - Refeed data with updates.\n",
    "  2. **Partial Updates:**\n",
    "     - Add the new field.\n",
    "     - Update documents with the new field.\n",
    "     - Transition queries to use the new field.\n",
    "  3. **Use Aliases:** Create aliases for fields if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Workflow:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Drop the old field and add the new one\n",
    "# Update your application to use the new field\n",
    "# Refeed the data with the new field\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Understanding Schemas and Parent/Child Relationships in Vespa\n",
    "\n",
    "Schemas play a crucial role in Vespa by defining how your data is structured, indexed, and searched. Additionally, understanding parent/child relationships allows you to model complex data structures efficiently. Let’s explore these concepts in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Schema in Vespa?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **schema** in Vespa defines the structure of your documents and how they should be processed. It specifies the **document types**, **fields**, **fieldsets**, and **rank profiles**. Essentially, a schema acts as a blueprint for your data, ensuring consistency and enabling efficient search and ranking operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components of a Schema:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Types:** Categories of documents, such as `music`, `books`, or `products`.\n",
    "- **Fields:** Attributes within a document, like `title`, `artist`, or `price`.\n",
    "- **Fieldsets:** Groups of fields that can be queried together.\n",
    "- **Rank Profiles:** Rules that determine how documents are scored and ranked in search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining a Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Schemas are stored in files with a `.sd` extension within the `schemas/` directory of your Vespa application package. Each schema file defines one or more document types and their respective fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Schema (`music.sd`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "schema music {\n",
    "    document music {\n",
    "        field artist type string {\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components Explained:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Block:** Defines the `music` document type with its fields.\n",
    "- **Fields:** Each field has a name, type, and indexing instructions.\n",
    "- **Fieldset:** Groups specific fields (`artist`, `title`, `album`) for easier querying.\n",
    "- **Rank Profile:** Specifies how documents of this type are ranked during searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components of a Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Types and Fields:**\n",
    "   - **Document:** The main entity, such as a song in the `music` schema.\n",
    "   - **Field:** An attribute of the document. Each field has a type (e.g., `string`, `int`) and indexing options.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fieldsets:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Group multiple fields together to streamline search queries and limit the data returned during read operations.\n",
    "   - **Built-in Fieldsets:**\n",
    "     - `[all]`: Returns all fields and the Document ID.\n",
    "     - `[document]`: Returns original fields and the Document ID.\n",
    "     - `[id]`: Returns only the Document ID.\n",
    "   - **Custom Fieldsets:**\n",
    "     - Defined by listing specific fields.\n",
    "     - **Example:** \n",
    "       ```yaml\n",
    "       fieldset myset {\n",
    "           fields: artist, title, album\n",
    "       }\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rank Profiles:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Determine how documents are scored and ranked in search results.\n",
    "   - **Inheritance:** Rank profiles can inherit from other profiles, allowing for reusable ranking logic.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     rank-profile song inherits default {\n",
    "         first-phase {\n",
    "             expression {\n",
    "                 nativeRank(artist, title) +\n",
    "                 if(isNan(attribute(popularity)) == 1, 0, attribute(popularity))\n",
    "             }\n",
    "         }\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Structs and Struct-Fields:**\n",
    "   - **Struct:** A composite type grouping multiple fields into a single unit.\n",
    "   - **Struct-Field:** Defines how specific fields within a struct are indexed and searched.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```yaml\n",
    "     struct email {\n",
    "         field sender type string {}\n",
    "         field recipient type string {}\n",
    "         field subject type string {}\n",
    "         field content type string {}\n",
    "     }\n",
    "\n",
    "     field emails type array<email> {\n",
    "         indexing: summary\n",
    "         struct-field content {\n",
    "             indexing: attribute\n",
    "             attribute: fast-search\n",
    "         }\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inheritance in Schemas and Document Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of schemas and document types, promoting reusability and reducing duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Schema Inheritance:**\n",
    "- A schema can inherit another, gaining all its definitions.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```yaml\n",
    "  schema books inherits items {\n",
    "      document books inherits items {\n",
    "          field author type string {\n",
    "              indexing: summary | index\n",
    "          }\n",
    "      }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Document Type Inheritance:**\n",
    "- A document type can inherit fields and rank profiles from another document type.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```yaml\n",
    "  schema music inherits items {\n",
    "      document music inherits items {\n",
    "          field artist type string {\n",
    "              indexing: summary | index\n",
    "          }\n",
    "      }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Reusability:** Common fields and rank profiles can be defined once and inherited by multiple document types.\n",
    "- **Consistency:** Ensures that similar document types share the same structure and ranking logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Managing Multiple Schemas and Content Clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "Vespa allows you to define multiple schemas within an application, each potentially mapped to different content clusters. This flexibility helps in scaling and optimizing performance based on different document types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Content Cluster with Multiple Schemas:**\n",
    "- All schemas are stored within a single content cluster.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",

    "Parent/child relationships allow you to model complex data structures by creating hierarchical links between documents. This is useful for applications with structured data, such as e-commerce platforms or advertising systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Simplify Operations:** Update related data with a single write operation.\n",
    "- **Avoid De-normalization:** No need to duplicate data across multiple documents.\n",
    "- **Efficient Searches:** Search child documents based on parent properties and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Parent References:** Use document references to establish parent/child links.\n",
    "- **Imported Fields:** Import fields from parent documents into child schemas for enhanced querying and ranking.\n",
    "- **No Cascade Delete:** Deleting a parent doesn’t automatically delete children.\n",
    "- **No Self or Cyclic References:** A document cannot reference itself or create cycles.\n",

    "### Annotations API in Vespa\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Annotations API** in Vespa allows you to add metadata to specific parts of your text data. This feature is useful for scenarios where you need to label or structure parts of your text, such as marking up HTML content or adding semantic information for natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Annotating Text with Spans\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Concepts:**\n",
    "- **Span:** A segment of text identified by a start index and length.\n",
    "- **Span Tree:** A hierarchical structure of spans that represents the annotations over the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case: Adding Simple Labels to Text**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you want to add metadata to an HTML document to identify different parts like headers, titles, and body content.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Define Annotation Types in Schema:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   schema example {\n",
    "       annotation text {}\n",
    "       annotation markup {}\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Annotate Text Using the API:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   StringFieldValue text = new StringFieldValue(\"<html><head><title>Diary</title></head><body>I live in San Francisco</body></html>\");\n",
    "\n",
    "   SpanList root = new SpanList();\n",
    "   root.add(new Span(0, 19))\n",
    "       .add(new Span(19, 5))\n",
    "       .add(new Span(24, 21))\n",
    "       .add(new Span(45, 23))\n",
    "       .add(new Span(68, 14));\n",
    "\n",
    "   SpanTree tree = new SpanTree(\"html\", root);\n",
    "   text.setSpanTree(tree);\n",
    "\n",
    "   // Adding annotations\n",
    "   AnnotationTypeRegistry atr = processing.getService().getDocumentTypeManager().getAnnotationTypeRegistry();\n",
    "\n",
    "   AnnotationType textType = atr.getType(\"text\");\n",
    "   AnnotationType markup = atr.getType(\"markup\");\n",
    "\n",
    "   Span span1 = new Span(0, 19);\n",
    "   tree.annotate(span1, markup);\n",
    "\n",
    "   Span span2 = new Span(19, 5);\n",
    "   tree.annotate(span2, textType);\n",

    "   Span span4 = new Span(45, 23);\n",
    "   tree.annotate(span4, textType);\n",
    "\n",
    "   Span span5 = new Span(68, 14);\n",
    "   tree.annotate(span5, markup);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:**\n",
    "   - **Span Definitions:** Each span marks a specific part of the HTML text.\n",
    "   - **Annotations:** Each span is labeled either as `markup` or `text`, providing semantic information about that section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building Annotation Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "For more complex annotations, such as creating a structured tree that represents nested elements or multiple interpretations, you can build **annotation trees** using `SpanList` and `SpanTree`.\n",

    "   - **Structured Tree:** The `SpanTree` now represents a hierarchical structure of the HTML document, allowing for more nuanced queries and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding Annotations with Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you need to attach more information to a span beyond simple labels. For example, annotating a city name with its geographical coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extend Schema with Value Fields:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   schema example {\n",
    "       annotation text {}\n",
    "       annotation begintag {}\n",

    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "2. **Annotate with Values:**\n",

    "   - **Structs in Annotations:** The `city` annotation includes a `position` struct with latitude and longitude.\n",
    "   - **Annotating with Values:** The span covering \"San Francisco\" is annotated with both the `text` label and the `city` annotation containing its coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working with Alternate Span Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, a single interpretation of the text isn't sufficient, especially in natural language processing where multiple interpretations exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Multiple Interpretations of a Sentence**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the sentence: \"I saw the girl with the telescope.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Annotation Types for Multiple Interpretations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   schema example {\n",
    "       annotation text {}\n",
    "       annotation begintag {}\n",
    "       annotation endtag {}\n",
    "       annotation body {}\n",
    "       annotation header {}\n",
    "       annotation city {\n",
    "           field latitude type double {}\n",
    "           field longitude type double {}\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build an Alternate Span Tree:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   StringFieldValue text = new StringFieldValue(\"<body><p>I saw the girl with the telescope</p></body>\");\n",
    "\n",
    "   SpanList root = new SpanList();\n",
    "   SpanTree tree = new SpanTree(\"html\", root);\n",
    "\n",
    "   AnnotationType textType = atr.getType(\"text\");\n",
    "   AnnotationType beginTag = atr.getType(\"begintag\");\n",
    "   AnnotationType endTag = atr.getType(\"endtag\");\n",
    "   AnnotationType bodyType = atr.getType(\"body\");\n",
    "   AnnotationType headerType = atr.getType(\"header\");\n",
    "   AnnotationType cityType = atr.getType(\"city\");\n",
    "\n",
    "   // Create city annotation with position\n",
    "   Struct position = (Struct) cityType.getDataType().createFieldValue();\n",
    "   position.setValue(\"latitude\", 37.774929);\n",
    "   position.setValue(\"longitude\", -122.419415);\n",
    "   Annotation city = new Annotation(cityType, position);\n",
    "\n",
    "   // Paragraph span\n",
    "   SpanList paragraph = new SpanList();\n",
    "   paragraph.add(new Span(6, 3))   // \"I \"\n",
    "            .add(new Span(9, 10))  // \"saw the gi\"\n",
    "            .add(new Span(19, 4))  // \"rl w\"\n",
    "            .add(new Span(23, 4)); // \"ith\"\n",
    "   tree.annotate(paragraph, headerType);\n",
    "   tree.annotate(new Span(6, 3), beginTag);\n",
    "   tree.annotate(new Span(9, 10), textType);\n",
    "   tree.annotate(new Span(19, 4), beginTag);\n",
    "   tree.annotate(new Span(23, 4), endTag);\n",
    "\n",
    "   // Text node with city annotation\n",
    "   SpanList textNode = new SpanList();\n",
    "   textNode.add(new Span(27, 9)) // \"telescope\"\n",
    "           .add(new Span(36, 8)); // \"</body>\"\n",
    "   tree.annotate(textNode, bodyType);\n",
    "   tree.annotate(new Span(27, 9), city);\n",
    "   tree.annotate(new Span(36, 8), endTag);\n",
    "\n",
    "   // Root annotations\n",
    "   root.add(new Span(0, 6))         // \"<body>\"\n",
    "       .add(paragraph)\n",
    "       .add(textNode);\n",
    "   tree.annotate(new Span(0, 6), beginTag);\n",
    "   tree.annotate(new Span(36, 8), endTag);\n",
    "   tree.annotate(city);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:**\n",
    "   - **Alternate Interpretations:** The annotation tree can represent multiple interpretations by allowing overlapping or multiple annotations.\n",
    "   - **Annotation References:** Annotations can reference other annotations to build a more complex graph, enabling richer metadata and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Manipulating Span Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, you'll need to modify existing span trees, such as updating annotations or restructuring the tree based on new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Removing Specific Annotations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to remove all `markup` annotations from a span tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iterate and Remove Annotations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```java\n",
    "   StringFieldValue text = new StringFieldValue(\"<html><head><title>Diary</title></head><body>I live in San Francisco</body></html>\");\n",
    "\n",
    "   SpanTree tree = text.getSpanTree(\"html\");\n",
    "   SpanList root = (SpanList) tree.getRoot();\n",
    "\n",
    "   ListIterator<SpanNode> nodeIt = root.childIterator();\n",
    "\n",
    "   AnnotationType markup = atr.getType(\"markup\");\n",
    "\n",
    "   while (nodeIt.hasNext()) {\n",
    "       SpanNode node = nodeIt.next();\n",
    "       Iterator<Annotation> annotationIt = tree.iterator(node);\n",
    "       \n",
    "       boolean hasMarkup = false;\n",
    "       while (annotationIt.hasNext()) {\n",
    "           Annotation annotation = annotationIt.next();\n",
    "           if (annotation.getType().equals(markup)) {\n",
    "               annotationIt.remove();\n",
    "               hasMarkup = true;\n",
    "           }\n",
    "       }\n",
    "       \n",
    "       if (hasMarkup) {\n",
    "           nodeIt.remove();\n",
    "           // Optionally, add replacement spans or annotations\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:**\n",
    "   - **Iterating Over SpanNodes:** Traverse each node in the span tree.\n",
    "   - **Removing Annotations:** Identify and remove annotations of the `markup` type.\n",
    "   - **Updating the Tree:** Optionally, modify the tree structure after removing annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inheritance of Annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotations can inherit from one another, allowing you to extend existing annotations with additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Extending an Annotation Type**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Base Annotation (`person`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   schema example {\n",
    "       annotation person {\n",
    "           field birthdate type int {}\n",
    "           field firstname type string {}\n",
    "           field lastname type string {}\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extend Annotation (`employee`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```yaml\n",
    "   schema example2 {\n",
    "       annotation employee inherits person {\n",
    "           field employeeid type int {}\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:**\n",
    "   - The `employee` annotation inherits all fields from `person` and adds an `employeeid` field.\n",
    "   - This allows `employee` to be used wherever `person` is applicable, promoting reusability and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
